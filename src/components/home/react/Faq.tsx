    question: "What addictions do you treat?",
    answer:
      "If it’s addictive, we treat it. Alcohol, opioids, benzos, stimulants, prescription medications, and more. But addiction isn’t just about substances—it’s about why. We also address trauma, anxiety, depression, and mental health conditions because real recovery means healing the root cause.",
  },
  {
    question: "How soon can I start?",
    answer:
      "Today. We offer same-day admissions because when you’re ready, waiting isn’t an option. Call now—we’ll take care of everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know I’m choosing the right treatment center?",
    answer:
      "Because we’re nationally accredited. West Valley Recovery is Joint Commission (JCAHO) accredited and LegitScript certified, meaning we meet the highest standards of safety, care, and long-term recovery success.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can my family be involved in my recovery?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Addiction affects everyone—so healing should, too. We offer family therapy, education, and ongoing support to help you and your loved ones move forward together.",
  },
  {
    question: " What if I’ve tried treatment before and it didn’t work?",
    answer:
      "Then you haven’t had the right treatment. Recovery isn’t about willpower—it’s about having a system that works. Our evidence-based, personalized approach gives you a plan that’s built around you. This time can be different. Let’s make it work.",
